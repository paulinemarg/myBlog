            As I started learning to code I became so excited that I wanted to learn everything all at once, like new programming languages, libraries and frameworks. But then I realised by focusing on learning new things I was neglecting my newly gained skills which still needed development and enhancement. 
            Therefore I have decided to work on my newly gained skills first and when I feel that I have mastered them I can move on to new ones.

            <h3>Maintaining Portfolio</h3>
            Besides enhancing and developing skills, it's always important to update your portfolio, like updating existing projects, adding new ones, writing case studies and even starting a blog if you like writing. But it's important to maintain your portfolio because it is one of the most vital things you have to 
            show off your skills and impress potential employers.
